# Image-Captioning-using-Neural-Networks
A neural network based implemenantion of Image Captioning based on the paper "Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention"


I made some changes to the architecture and to some hyper-params to attain improvement in the performance of the model. This model will work using Tenforflow 1.1 and Python 3.7.
